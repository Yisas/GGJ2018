# Dungeon of the Mind

## Overview
[Dungeon of the Mind](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/dungeon-mind) is a submission for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) 2018 edition, developed in 48 hours using Unity3D. It is a 3D, 3rd person co-operative puzzle-platformer video game where perspective is altered for players. The world you see may not be correct or complete, and you will need to rely on both your vision and your partner's to overcome the dungeon's puzzles. Communication is key to advance through the dungeon.
